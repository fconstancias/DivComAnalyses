The goal of DivComAnalyses is to facilitate community analysis (e.g., 16S community metabarcoding, metaphlan taxonomic profiling from metagenomes). In data filtering (i.e., potential contaminants identified using decontam R package), in normalizing data (i.e., 16S qPCR normalization), generate phylogenetic and taxonomic alpha and beta-diversity metrics, visualize community composition and structure using unconstrained and constrained ordination, facilitate statistical analysis based on DEseq2, ALDex2, vegan R packages.

## Tutorial

You can find the latest version of the tutorial [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fconstancias/DivComAnalyses/blob/master/Tutorial/Microbiome_R_tutorial.html).


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fconstancias/DivComAnalyses")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(DivComAnalyses)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
